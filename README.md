A Docker is an open-source platform that allows you to build, package, and run applications in isolated environments called containers.



What is a Container?
A container is like a lightweight, standalone mini-computer that runs your app and everything it needs (code, libraries, tools) — but without the overhead of a full operating system like a virtual machine.



What is Docker used for?
Packaging apps: Bundle your app and its environment so it works the same everywhere — on your laptop, a server, or in the cloud.

Isolation: Keep apps and dependencies separate and secure.

Portability: Move containers between different environments easily.

Efficiency: Containers share the same OS kernel, making them fast and lightweight compared to virtual machines.
